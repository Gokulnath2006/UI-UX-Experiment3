# UI-UX-Experiment3

## Aim:

The aim of this experiment is to apply heuristic evaluation of existing websites or apps and redesign them by combining features of two competing applications to improve the overall user experience.

## Algorithm:

**Project Name:** UX Evaluation – Amazon vs Flipkart

**Choose Pages and Features to Test**

   * Homepage: Check banners, menus, and search bar.
   * Search: Try searching products and filtering results.
   * Product Listing Page: Look at product cards, sorting, and filtering.
   * Product Details Page: Check information clarity, images, reviews.
   * Checkout Process: Evaluate how easy it is to complete a purchase.

**Check Using Heuristics**

   * Use basic UX rules like:
   * Easy to navigate and understand
   * Consistent layout and colors
   * Clear feedback when users do something (like add to cart)
   * Minimize errors and make recovery easy

**Identify Problems**
   * Note anything confusing, slow, or cluttered.
   * Example: “Search results are confusing” or “Add-to-cart button is hard to see.”

**Rate the Severity**
   * Minor: Slight inconvenience
   * Moderate: Makes the task harder but not impossible
   * Major: Blocks user from completing a task

**Suggest Improvements**
   * For each problem, write a simple fix.
   * Example: “Make the search bar bigger” or “Use consistent colors for buttons.”

**Redesign (Optional)**
   * Make mockups of improved pages using a design tool or AI image generator.
   * Focus on clearer layout, easy navigation, and visually appealing design.

**Compare Old vs New**
   * Take screenshots of the original pages and the redesigns.
   * Show how your suggestions improve user experience.

**Target Audience**
* People who shop online often and want fast, easy, and smooth browsing.
* Users who like a clean and consistent design with clear information.
